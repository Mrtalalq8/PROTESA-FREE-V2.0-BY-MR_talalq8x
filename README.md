### Introduction

**PROTESA FREE PROTECTOR V2.0** is a VB.NET application designed to encrypt executable files (.exe) using a randomly generated encryption key, providing an additional level of security for files. The program features an easy-to-use interface that allows users to select a file, generate an encryption key, and save the encrypted file to a chosen location.

### Key Features

1. **Browse Executable File**: The program allows users to select an executable (.exe) file from the device to encrypt.
   - **Browse Button**: Allows the user to select a file from the system through an open dialog.

2. **Generate Encryption Key**: The program generates a random encryption key used to encrypt the file.
   - **Generate CryptKEY Button**: Allows the user to generate a new encryption key.

3. **File Encryption**: The program encrypts the executable file using the AES algorithm and saves it to a user-specified location.
   - **Protect Button**: Encrypts the selected file and saves it to the chosen location.

4. **Developer Information**: The program displays developer information on the main interface with a label showing "Developed by: MR_talalq8x".

### Main Interface Components

- **Browse Server Button**: Allows users to select an executable file to encrypt.
- **File Path Textbox**: Displays the path of the selected file.
- **Generate CryptKEY Button**: Generates a random encryption key.
- **Encryption Key Textbox**: Displays the generated encryption key.
- **Protect Button**: Starts the encryption process and allows the user to save the encrypted file to the desired location.
- **Program Logo**: Displays the program's logo on the interface.
- **Developer Label**: Displays the developer's name "Developed by: MR_talalq8x".

### How to Use

1. Open the program to display the main interface.
2. Click the **Browse Server** button to select the executable file you want to encrypt.
3. After selecting the file, click the **Generate CryptKEY** button to generate the encryption key.
4. Click the **Protect** button to encrypt the file. A save dialog will appear; choose the appropriate location.
5. After completion, the encrypted file will be saved to the location you specified.

### Requirements

- Windows Operating System.
- .NET Framework runtime environment to run the application.

### Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: VB.NET.
- **Encryption**: The program uses the AES encryption algorithm to provide strong protection for files.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `System.IO` for file handling.
  - `System.Security.Cryptography` for key generation and encryption.

### Important Note

This program is designed for educational purposes only and should not be used for any illegal activities. File encryption should be performed carefully to ensure that access to important files is not lost.

### Developer

- **Name**: MR_talalq8x
- **GitHub**: [Mrtalalq8](https://github.com/Mrtalalq8)

### Future Releases

- Add a decryption option for protected files.
- Improve the user interface by adding more colors and graphics.
- Provide support for more file types beyond executable files.
